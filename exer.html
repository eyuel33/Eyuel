            <p>A car or automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, 
                seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people (rather than goods).[1][2]

                Cars were invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.[3][4][5]
                 Cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, 
                 an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn 
                 carriages.[6] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[7] 
                 The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy. Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, 
                 and a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more 
                 complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the 
                 early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fuelled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars,
                  which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy
                   than gasoline cars before 2025.[8][9] The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change
                    mitigation scenarios,[10] such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.[11]

                 There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments 
                 (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance.
                 [12] The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, noise pollution,
                  public health and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related
                   deaths worldwide.[13] Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.[14]
                    Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation
                     provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes. People's ability 
                     to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[15]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car"

                    <p> A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed to transport cargo, carry specialized payloads, 
                        or perform other utilitarian work. Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration,
                         but the vast majority feature body-on-frame construction, with a cabin that is independent of the payload portion
                          of the vehicle. Smaller varieties may be mechanically similar to some automobiles. Commercial trucks can be very large
                           and powerful and may be configured to be mounted with specialized equipment, such as in the case of refuse trucks,
                            fire trucks, concrete mixers, and suction excavators. In American English, a commercial vehicle without a trailer or
                             other articulation is formally a "straight truck" while one designed specifically to pull a trailer is not a truck
                              but a "tractor".[1]</p>

                              The majority of trucks currently in use are still powered by diesel engines, although small- to medium-size trucks
                               with gasoline engines exist in the US, Canada, and Mexico. The market-share of electrically powered trucks is growing
                                rapidly, expected to reach 7% globally by 2027, and electric motive force already predominates among both the largest
                                 and smallest trucks.[2] In the European Union, vehicles with a gross combination mass of up to 3.5 t (3.4 long tons;
                                  3.9 short tons) are known as light commercial vehicles, and those over as large goods vehicles.
